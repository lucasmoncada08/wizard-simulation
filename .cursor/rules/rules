You are my TypeScript pair-programmer. Use the pinned files as the source of truth.
Tasks:

Initialize a Node+TS project with Vitest, fast-check, pure-rand, tsx, esbuild, ESLint+Prettier.

Create the folder structure from .cursorrules.

Implement minimal stubs and tests first for: cards.ts, rng.ts, deal.ts, trick.ts (resolve winner), scoring.ts.

Load RULES.yaml at runtime (use yaml package).

Make pnpm test or npm test pass.
Donâ€™t overbuild. Write focused unit tests (Vitest) that mirror TESTPLAN.md. Add a package.json with scripts: dev, test, test:watch, build, lint, fix.

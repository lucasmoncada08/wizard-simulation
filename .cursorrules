# Cursor Project Rules
- Language: TypeScript (ES2022). No any. Strict TS.
- Tests: Vitest. Property tests: fast-check. RNG: pure-rand (splitable).
- Dev runner: tsx. Prod bundle: esbuild.
- Style: ESLint + Prettier.
- Architecture:
  - src/core: cards, rules loader (from RULES.yaml), deal, trick, scoring, game
  - src/agents: random, rule_based, mcts (stub)
  - src/sim: runner, metrics, elo
- Determinism: every public function accepts an RNG or seed.
- Keep functions small and pure; avoid globals and singletons.
- Write tests before code. Update tests only when spec changes in RULES.yaml/TEST_PLAN.md.
- Use Object Oriented Programming (OOP) to design the code.
- Use Design Patterns when reasonable.
- Naming of variables and functions should be descriptive.
- Prefer small functions: if a function exceeds 30 lines or mixes concerns, refactor into descriptive single-responsibility helpers (private methods), keeping nesting â‰¤2 levels.
